Code repository of our research paper on AI-generated music detection - D. Afchar, G. Meseguer Brocal, R. Hennequin (2024).

Examples of audio reconstructions may be found in the `audio_examples` folder or on the demo page: [research.deezer.com/deepfake-detector/](https://research.deezer.com/deepfake-detector/).

The FMA dataset is available at [github.com/mdeff/fma](https://github.com/mdeff/fma).

_Most of our experiment code is available for the review. We will make the trained weights open source for the publication._
